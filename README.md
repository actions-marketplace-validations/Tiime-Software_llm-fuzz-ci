# LLM Fuzz CI

[![Tests](https://github.com/Tiime-Software/llm-fuzz-ci/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Tiime-Software/llm-fuzz-ci/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

[Blog post](https://tiime-software.github.io/blog/llm-fuzz-ci/)

Fuzz your Python or JavaScript code with a coding agent, in GitHub Actions.

Mark a test. The agent reads your code and writes adversarial inputs for it.

## Quick start

Mark the tests you want fuzzed. The agent fills the input with arguments for the call.

```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.llm_fuzz(budget_usd=0.5)
def test_foo(llm_fuzz_case):
    result = foo(**llm_fuzz_case.input)
    assert "<script>" not in result
```

For vitest, `npm install --save-dev github:Tiime-Software/llm-fuzz-ci` and mark it the same way:

```js
import { expect } from "vitest";
import { fuzzTest } from "llm-fuzz-ci";

fuzzTest("foo escapes its input", { budgetUsd: 0.5 }, (input) => {
  expect(foo(input.value)).not.toContain("<script>");
});
```

Add `.github/workflows/llm-fuzz-ci.yml`:

```yaml
name: LLM Fuzz CI

  workflow_dispatch:

          path: |
            .llm-fuzz
            !.llm-fuzz/reports/vitest-results
```

For a Node project, add `actions/setup-node` and `npm ci` to both jobs, and make
the test command `npx vitest run .fuzz.`.

Run it from the Actions tab.

An annotated copy is in
[`templates/llm-fuzz-ci.yml`](templates/llm-fuzz-ci.yml).

## Marker options

| Argument     | Description                                                                                                 |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `budget_usd` | Per-test spend limit.                                                                                       |
| `params`     | Limit generation to these input keys. Without it the agent works out the whole signature from your harness. |

```python
@pytest.mark.llm_fuzz(budget_usd=0.5, params=["amount"])
def test_transfer(llm_fuzz_case):
    result = transfer(account_id="acct_1", amount=llm_fuzz_case.input["amount"])
    assert result.amount >= 0
```

## Configuration

| Input                | Default | Description                                  |
| -------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `test-paths`         | `tests` | paths holding marked tests                   |
| `runner`             | `auto`  | `pytest`, `vitest`, or `auto` from the paths |
| `working-directory`  | `.`     | subdirectory to run in                       |
| `agent`              | `codex` | `codex` or `claude`                          |
| `model`              |         | model for the agent; empty uses its default  |
| `provider`           |         | Codex provider, for example `openrouter`     |
| `openai-api-key`     |         | key for `codex`                              |
| `openrouter-api-key` |         | key for `provider: openrouter`               |
| `anthropic-api-key`  |         | key for `claude`                             |
| `max-budget-usd`     |         | override every marker budget                 |
| `price-input-per-million`  |   | Codex: model price, USD per million input tokens |
| `price-output-per-million` |   | Codex: model price, USD per million output tokens |
| `timeout-seconds`    | `600`   | maximum generation time per target           |
| `show-usage`         | `false` | print the agent's token usage and cost       |

`llm-fuzz-ci report`, step 3:

| Flag                | Description                                                                  |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--create-issue`    | open an issue when an input failed; needs `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `issues: write` |
| `--issue-assignees` | comma-separated logins; GitHub emails an assignee                            |
| `--issue-labels`    | comma-separated labels                                                       |
| `--hard-fail`       | exit non-zero when an input failed                                           |

Both are off unless you pass them, so the same command works for a run you only
want to look at.

## Alerts

Every run writes a summary to the Actions run page: one row per marked test with
its outcome, each failing input in full with the assertion that fired.

The `llm-fuzz-ci` artifact holds the whole run:

|                                 |                                                 |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `cases/`                        | every input the agent wrote, as JSON Lines      |
| `targets.json`                  | the marked tests it was pointed at              |
| `reports/llm-fuzz-ci-report.md` | the same summary, unfolded                      |
| `reports/test-report.json`      | one record per input, for processing            |
| `reports/llm-usage.json`        | tokens and dollars spent                        |
| `reports/agent-trace/`          | per test, what the agent reasoned, ran, and saw |

All of the following are off unless you turn them on.

**An issue.** With `create-issue: true` every failing run opens one, titled with the number of failing inputs and linking back to the run. Needs `issues: write`.

**An email.** GitHub emails the assignee of an issue, use`issue-assignees: you` and `issue-labels`.

**A red build.** `hard-fail: true`, the default. The failure is the last thing the action does, so the summary, the artifact and the issue all land first. It fails the job, which skips the steps after it and any job that `needs:` it; jobs already running in parallel are not cancelled.

**A badge.** Add the workflow's status badge to your README. It shows the last run on a branch: green when it passed, red when it failed.

```markdown
[![LLM Fuzz CI](https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/actions/workflows/llm-fuzz-ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/actions/workflows/llm-fuzz-ci.yml)
```

Replace `OWNER/REPO` and use the file name of your workflow. The badge is red only while `hard-fail: true` (the default) fails the job on a failing input. With `hard-fail: false` it stays green, so keep the default if you want the badge to track the fuzzing result. Scheduled and manual runs count too. On a private repository only people with access see the status. Without `?branch=main` the badge follows the latest run on any branch.

**Anything else.** The action outputs `failed-inputs`, so a step of your own can post to Slack, Teams, or a pager:

Set `hard-fail: false` when you do that, or the job dies before your step runs.

## Agents

| Agent             | Key                                                                   |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `codex` (default) | `openai-api-key`, or `openrouter-api-key` with `provider: openrouter` |
| `claude`          | `anthropic-api-key`                                                   |

### Budgets with Codex

Codex counts tokens, not dollars. To enforce `budget_usd` it needs the model's
prices, so a Codex run with a budget and no prices stops before any agent runs.

Set `model` as well. Codex's default model changes between versions, and the
prices must match the model that runs. Prices as listed in September 2026, USD
per million tokens; check your provider's page before you rely on them:

| Model                          | Input | Output |
| ------------------------------ | ----: | -----: |
| `gpt-6-astra`                  | 10.00 |  50.00 |
| `mistralai/mistral-large-4-0`  |  0.68 |   2.09 |

```yaml
with:
  agent: codex
  provider: openrouter
  model: mistralai/mistral-large-4-0
  openrouter-api-key: ${{ secrets.OPENROUTER_API_KEY }}
  price-input-per-million: "0.68"
  price-output-per-million: "2.09"
```

The action turns each budget into a Codex token limit, weighted by those
prices, and Codex aborts the test's run when it is used up. The check happens
between model replies, so one reply can overshoot the budget. Codex marks this
feature as under development. For a hard cap, also set a credit limit on the
key at your provider.

## Command line

The action wraps a CLI you can run locally.

```bash
pip install "git+https://github.com/Tiime-Software/llm-fuzz-ci.git@v1"
export CODEX_API_KEY=...

llm-fuzz-ci collect tests                                   # find marked tests
llm-fuzz-ci generate --dry-run                              # print the prompt, spend nothing
llm-fuzz-ci generate                                        # write .llm-fuzz/cases
llm-fuzz-ci test-fuzz-cases --require-cases -- tests -q     # run them
llm-fuzz-ci summary                                         # render the report
```

## Help writing the tests

Choosing what to fuzz and what to assert is the part that takes thought.
[`skills/SKILL.md`](skills/SKILL.md) is an agent skill for exactly that: it picks
out the functions worth fuzzing, writes the marked tests.
